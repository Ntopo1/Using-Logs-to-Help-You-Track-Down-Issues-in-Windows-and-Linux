<h1> Using Logs to Help You Track Down an Issue in Windows and Linux</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this lab, I'll use logs to help you troubleshoot and track down issues in a Windows environment and a Linux environment. I will update out-of-date software, find and delete files, modify file permissions, find and terminate specific processes in both Windows and Linux.</p> 
<br />
<h2>Utilities Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Windows</b> -Operating system used for first half of the lab</li>
    <li><b>Event View</b> -Program used to view event logs</li>
    <li><b>File Explorer</b> -Program used to find files</li>
    <li><b>Task Manager</b> -Program used to view running processes and programs</li>
    <li><b>Ubuntu</b> -Operating system used for the second half.</li>
    <li><b>Apache2</b> -Web server software for hosting websites</li>
</ul>

<h3>Windows Tasks:</h3>
<h4>Task 1:</h4>
<p>Define a function: Write a program that minimizes the line of code to have your robot jump the hurdles:</p>

</p>
<p align="left"> This code can be written more concisely by using a for loop written as:</p>
"for x in range(6):</br>
>>>>    hurdle()"
<br />
<br />
<h4>Task 2:</h4> 
<p>While loop: Reeborg is participating in a hurdle race without knowing the race's length beforehand. He must run the course, similar to a specified path, and stop only at the flag displayed after the race starts.</p> 
<br />

</p>
<p align="left"> The number of hurdles now change each time the map is loaded. This while loop will until the robot reaches the finish line. </p> 
<br /> 
<br />
<h4>Task 3:</h4>
<p>While Loop and if statement: Reeborg has entered a hurdle race. Make him run the course, following the path shown. The position and number of hurdles change each time this world is reloaded.</p>

<br />
<br />
<h4>Task 4:</h4> 
<p> Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flashlight ran out.

Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort:</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p >This was a fun way of seeing our code in action and how the logic and indentation of your code have a big impact on the results. That's it for day 6.</p>
