<h1> Using Logs to Help You Track Down an Issue in Windows and Linux</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In this lab, I'll use logs to help you troubleshoot and track down issues in a Windows environment and a Linux enviroment.</p> 
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 1:</h3>
<p>Define a function: Write a program that minimizes the line of code to have your robot jump the hurdles:</p> 
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="left"> This code can be written more concisely by using a for loop written as:</p>
"for x in range(6):</br>
>>>>    hurdle()"
<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 2:</h3> 
<p>While loop: Reeborg is participating in a hurdle race without knowing the race's length beforehand. He must run the course, similar to a specified path, and stop only at the flag displayed after the race starts.</p> 
<br /> 
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="left"> The number of hurdles now change each time the map is loaded. This while loop will until the robot reaches the finish line. </p> 
<br /> 
<br />
<h3>Task 3:</h3>
<p>While Loop and if statement: Reeborg has entered a hurdle race. Make him run the course, following the path shown. The position and number of hurdles change each time this world is reloaded.</p> 
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="left"> The code below takes into account variable hurdle heights:  </p>

<br />
<br />
<h3>Task 4:</h3> 
<p> Reeborg was exploring a dark maze and the battery in its flashlight ran out.

Write a program using an if/elif/else statement so Reeborg can find the exit. The secret is to have Reeborg follow along the right edge of the maze, turning right if it can, going straight ahead if it canâ€™t turn right, or turning left as a last resort:</p>

</p>
<p align="left"> My robot took the long way around. But by following this algorithm it was able to make it to the end. </p> 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<p >This was a fun way of seeing our code in action and how the logic and indentation of your code have a big impact on the results. That's it for day 6.</p>
